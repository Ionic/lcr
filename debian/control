Description: LinuxCallRouter - an ISDN based PBX for Linux
 Formerly known as "PBX4Linux", Linux-Call-Router is not only a router,
 it is a real ISDN PBX which interconnects ISDN telephones and ISDN lines.
 It is possible to connect telephones to a Linux box. It is a pure software
 solution except for the ISDN cards and telephones. The great benefit is
 the NT-mode that allows to connect telephones to an ISDN card. Special
 cards are needed and a little bit of different cabeling. It supports lots
 of features, that only expensive PBXs have. It include a channel driver
 that can link LCR to Asterisk PBX.
